The Fibonacci series is a series where the next term is the sum of the previous two terms.
The first two terms of the fibonacci sequence are 0 followed by 1.

Example- Fibonacci series 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34

Suppose, our first two terms are:
firstTerm =  0
secondTerm = 1

The next terms in the Fibonacci series would be calculated as:
nextTerm = firstTerm + secondTerm; (0 + 1)
firstTerm = secondTerm; (1)
secondTerm = nextTerm; (1)
nextTerm = firstTerm + secondTerm; (1 + 1) ..........

class Codechef
{
    public static void main(String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
    {
        // Fibonacci series 

        int n = 10;
        System.out.println("The Fibonacci series for " + n + " terms is ");

        int firstTerm = 0;
        int secondTerm = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            System.out.print(firstTerm + ",");
            int nextTerm = firstTerm + secondTerm;
            firstTerm = secondTerm;
            secondTerm = nextTerm;
        }

    }
